h2. jQuery Placeholder

h3. DESCRIPTION

A very basic, very small placeholder jQuery plugin. It's only 756 bytes when minified and you can always remove the license text, making it about 300 bytes shorter, but you really shouldn't do that :)

This plugin is useful when you want a text field to display a value that hints at what the user is supposed to type. Text disapears when text field is focused and restored if the text field is left blank.

Tested with jquery 1.3.2 and 1.4.0.

h3. USAGE

<pre>	$("input").placeholder();
</pre>

h3. OPTIONS

|*Option*|*Description*|*Default Value*|
|text|text to serve as placeholder|'enter text'|
